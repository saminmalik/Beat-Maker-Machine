2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

Firstly, I want address that I barely have knowledge in terms of web development. I started learning last semester but couldn’t continue due to Covid. Even though the instruction on Code Path was very clear, however, there was this one part where I faced the most trouble. It was part 7. Right after I copied and pasted the snippet of code for generating sound and followed the instruction, I couldn’t hear the sound. I have checked my code multiple times, but I didn’t find any issues regarding my code. I primarily use Safari. So, I looked up online and found an answer that said it is mostly due to the browser I was using. So, I tried using chrome and I still couldn’t resolve the problem. Then, I asked regarding this to my friends for 2 hour and I couldn’t come up with any solution. Later, I checked the console on Chrome and found out the problem. I found out that this is happening due to a new policy that few browsers are implementing. If our browsers (including Chrome) are updated, then most likely it won't work consistently. So, I tried adding extra few codes to do it the way the new policy was implemented which took me 3 hours trying to make it work and still failed. So I immediately contacted Code Path regarding this and I explained this technical error. Fortunately, I was connected to this TA who mentioned that they are aware of this problem and I won’t be penalized.

As, I was very new to these languages, I had to learn while Following the tasks; for example, what keywords to use to change the positioning, sizing, and coloring. I had to use other sources that I have mentioned above to figure ways out to get my objects to the middle of the page.

Also, I went out of my way to use this open source that led me to this beautiful background. However, I had to change few things in the background so that it fits my need and to make the background more intuitive. I had to fix the study the code that was used to make the background and add more details like color, speed, exposures, and having the crystals move along the cursor. This took a bit of time as I had to use this Udemy course to understand JavaScript and CSS in more depth to make add and makes changes to the background.

All in all, this experience taught me a lot, not only in terms of web development, but also time management. I had 4 midterms and school projects due in the past few days. I had to manage and set some time apart to do this task. I found Web development so interesting that my passion for this led me to devote my extra time on learning and doing this pre-work.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

To be honest, I don’t have many questions about web development, but I have it for myself. Before completing these tasks, the first thing that came to my mind was “Why web development?” And, now that question turned into, “what more can I do with it?” I figured that web development is such potential platform and it has endless and creative things to do that can change a lot in this world. Now, I want to know what is full stack programming,React js, Express js, Node, and MangoDb. This first project in web development made me even more hungry for this internship. I hope to learn more and keep answering these questions to myself by exploring web development more.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

So, I changed the theme of the game for my website. I made the buttons on the web to be like the beat making machine which Djs use in the raves or discos. Which is why, I went with this background and color scheme. I would have added audio clips of actual beats on each button that djs play for their songs, as in when you complete the pattern it will end up like a complete beat-rhythm of various songs. Also, I would have added more buttons/functions that would allow the users to choose difficulty from easy to hard which would let the speed up the clue playback of user’s own choice. I would have also added a black image under that buttons to make it look more like a beat making machine. Lastly, I would also add background sound to match with the beat-rhythms that gets played on the game. These are some, ideas that I still intend to create after I submit the pre work.
